"# Chrome-Weather-Extension" 

This is a basic chrome extension built using AngularJS, jQuery and angular-google-maps.

The extension displays weather information to the user allowing them to change their location and receive relevant information.

The extension has been built predominantly as an excercise in understanding AngularJS and building applications from scratch.

##Current missing features and issues/bugs:

- Map is the first thing the user sees in the sections panel.
	-Should be the extra info section but due to the google maps api not rendering this is not the case.

- Weather icons missing in the weather section

- No 'Settings'
	- Provide option to change temperature to F instead of C
	- Change colour scheme of the extension (?)

##Usage
To use the extension you will need Google Chrome internet browser.
- Download the project.
- Open Chrome and navigate to 'chrome://extensions'
- Select 'Load unpacked extension...'
- Navigate to the location where you downloaded the extension and click 'Ok'

##Issues and suggestions
- If you find an issue within the extension please message me and I will fix it, alternatively fork the project and fix it yourself.
- All critiques on design decisions are appreciated as this is the first attempt at using AngularJS the author has made.
